This program aims to provide research experiences to undergraduate students and equip them with basic theoretical and computational skills. Students will be working under the supervision of domestic astrophysicists, on a wide range of topics from cosmology to planet formation. Frontier techniques in astronomy, problem solving skills, and numerical programing will be learned during this program. Participants are required to present their results publicly at the end of the program. Further continuation of the research project after the summer program can be possible. </p>

                                    Exciting international efforts, such as GRAVITY and Event Horizon Telescope collaborations, have made horizon-scaled observations possible. The dynamical electromagnetic signals from the vicinity of black holes provide unique opportunities for testing general relativity and exploring properties of the black hole system. In the project, by applying a general relativistic ray-tracing code -- <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...820..105P/abstract"  target="_blank ">Odyssey</a>, we aim to model orbiting hot spots around black holes, and study the dynamical, observable features of the spots.</td>

Multi-phase flows of hot, tenuous gases, cold dense clumps and relativistic particles can pass between the circum-galactic environment and the interstellar medium of a galaxy, regulating activities such as star-formation. In this project, we will model observational signatures of the physical structure and composition of these flows. This will be important to understand more clearly how they impact on an evolving galaxy and its internal environment.</td>

Due to the extreme interactions, ultra-high-energy particles and turbulent magnetic fields were often expelled into the intergalactic space. This study aims to determine the polarised synchrotron radiation from complex, non-thermal magneto-ionic plasmas around groups of proto-galaxies. Under guidance, the student will learn to build scenarios, construct models and carry out numerical computations on the high-performance computing clusters, mainly using the cosmological polarised radiative transfer (CPRT) code developed in-house by the supervisors.</td>

We study and apply a selection of these methods (e.g., approximate Bayesian computation, genetic algorithms, neural networks) on real cosmological data and so add insight into the robustness of the values of the cosmological parameters obtained traditionally. We assess the perks and quirks of each method related to their impact on the analysis of the standard cosmological model and, if allowed by time constraints, beyond.</td>

Of particular interest in this project is the interplay between ambipolar diffusion and shocks. Our team performed both the local instability analysis as well as numerical simulations and found that these shocks are dynamically unstable and can become chaotic. As a continuous effort of theoretical prediction, we are inviting a summer student to work with us to better understand the shock substructure.</td>
